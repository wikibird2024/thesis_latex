Falls are among the leading causes of serious injuries in the elderly and other high-risk populations. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive real-time fall detection and alert system, built on an integrated and distributed architecture.

The system consists of two main detection components, each optimized for a specific monitoring scope. The first component is a wearable system, utilizing an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track user movement and posture within a mobile range. The second component is a fixed computer vision system, employing video analysis algorithms to monitor critical areas such as living rooms or bedrooms. When a fall event is detected by any component, the information is transmitted to a central processing platform.

All processing and control logic is executed on an embedded ESP32 platform, offering optimal performance and cost efficiency. Once a fall is confirmed, the alert data is encoded in JSON format and transmitted to a server via the MQTT protocol, ensuring minimal latency. This architecture enables the system to maintain reliability even if one of the components fails.

The system also integrates an automated telecommunication solution based on Asterisk PBX and a 4G-GPS module, allowing automatic emergency calls, SMS notifications containing precise GPS coordinates, and sharing images from the scene via OTT messaging applications, providing fast and multi-channel responses.

The outcome of this research is a modular and highly extensible architecture, facilitating future integration of additional sensors or alert methods. The system demonstrates a harmonious combination of embedded IoT, automated telecommunications, and intelligent data analysis, contributing significantly to improving community safety and quality of life.
